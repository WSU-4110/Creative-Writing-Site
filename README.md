# Context: 
A website for professional and amateur writers who want to publish their stories for free and without a publisher. 
Users can upload short stories or novels that they have created and have the option to either make their work private for themselves or make them public for others to see. Also allow users who don’t want to publish anything view, read, and follow authors that they might like. This gives opportunity for authors who would not otherwise see their work published, it gives them an opportunity to show others their work.
# Problem:
Presently most people read books through either a hard copy from a library or bookstore or electronically from their phones. Electronically most people get books either from the IOS book app or from the google play store, and the only books available are published books from authors and publishers and most books cost money to read. This website can give people a free alternative to read. In order for authors to get published they most go through publishers who have to decide whether or not they deem someone’s work to be worth publishing. This website allows users to bypass that and be able to publish their own work.

# Solution:
This website serves to help give amateur and even professional writers a platform where their work can be seen and read by others. Websites like this only exist for musicians, where musicians can post their work, but not for authors. Many musicians nowadays get record deals based off of amateur work they uploaded to places like SoundCloud, this website serves the same purpose for authors to get recognized, and it also provides a place for people to read the work that is uploaded, like a digital library. This website provides authors with their own profile where people can follow them so that the next time they publish something their followers have easy access to the newly published work.

# Audience:
 The audience for this project are amateur writers who want to publish their work, whether their purpose be to gain attention by a large publisher or they just want their work to be seen, and for users who want to read work created by independent authors for free.
